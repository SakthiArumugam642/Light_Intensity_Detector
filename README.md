# Light_Intensity_Detector
A Light intensity measuring instrument is a device that detects light. It generates an output signal in (volts) that is proportional to the intensity of light.A light sensor measures the radiant energy present in the wide range of frequencies in the light spectrum. Some of the common frequencies are infrared, visible and ultraviolet. A Light Sensor is also called as Photo Sensor or Photo electric Sensor or photo conductors or photocells or photo conducting cells as it converts light energy or photons in to electrical signals. There are different types of light sensors for different applications. A Photocell or Photo Resistor is the common type of light sensor. A photo resistor changes its resistance when light is falling on it. Hence, a photo resistor is also called as Light Dependent Resistor or LDR. When there is no light, the resistance of LDR is very high. When there is light falling on the LDR, its resistance decreases. There are a wide range of applications of light sensors includes home automations,automatic front doom light switching on and off in vehicles etc,
